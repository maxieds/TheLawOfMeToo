# An emotional Facebook appeal on why Donald Trump should never be re-elected in this country

## Initial post

This is sick. I just want to remind everyone who supports Donald Trump in the next election that Kavanaugh, one of his top supreme Court picks, raped a female professor at a prestigious University decades ago when she was a student in prep school. Instead of expressing remorse for how this brave woman had been victimized, the Republicans in Congress grilled her ruthlessly about small order details of the sexual violence she had experienced at the hands (or small what have ye) of this powerful man. Kavanaugh was eventually confirmed and now sits offering decisive opinions in the most exclusive court in the land. How can we expect attitudes to change when this is in spirit in place right at the top of our country. I chipped in what I could today so I can write this. Echoing other 4-letter sentiments below, Fuck Trump! Let's stop this from happening to anyone else.

## Follow-up post

Because I know someone who has been through this, I would like to echo a more light hearted comment from my mother, Sarah. I responded to her that I think the penalty for raping a woman in this country should not be (mere) jail time, but for the perpetrator to "have their dick cut off". Mama responds: "Do you have any idea how many dickless men we would have running around this country?" To which I countered: "Do you have any idea how many fewer rapes we would have in this country?"
