# Open letter to congress and/or senate (my experience as a victim)

Dear [US Law Maker Name], 

I am writing to your office to advocate for change nationwide to the state-by-state laws that 
offer statutes of limitation and effective windows of prosecution of offenders to victims of 
rape and sexual assault. In doing so, I will share my experiences as a survivor and victim of 
prolonged stalking and rape across the country by an attacker whose name is known to me. 
Recently, within the past few years, I have finally decided to speak out against my primary 
attacker to protect myself and feel safe and confident that he would no longer be a threat to 
raping or victimizing me yet again in my current state of residence where I am living to complete my 
Ph.D. in mathematics. 

I first encountered my initial stalker (and later rapist) when I enrolled at a large public university in the 
state of Illinois in 2004. He was a prominent, and well known, "superstar", but non-tenured, male 
lecturer who for nearly a decade taught required courses 
throughout the engineering school among several other liberal arts degree tracks on campus. This man stalked and 
harassed me then, a pattern of his behavior and antisocial personality ticks which began to periodically 
follow me through my moves and personal treks across the country. 
While I was an undergraduate student and graduate student in Illinois, I was led to believe 
that this man's conspicuous appearances and actions towards me were an innocuous expression of some 
feigned long-time romantic interest on his part which I could justifyably just ignore as unwanted without any 
consequences to my physical well being. 

When I moved out of state to Seattle, WA in mid 2014 to pursue my Ph.D. a long way away from any family or 
friends I had come to know would look out for me before that time, his stalking appearances and 
actions were markedly more hostile, aggressive, and 
violent towards me moving forward. I believe that this man was able have me unwittingly ingest a 
"date rape drug" substance and then subsequently sexually assault me at least once in the latter months of 2014. 
I knew, for one reason or another, what 
had happened to me then, but was unable to report the rape and stalking incidents to authorities due to a state of shock, 
extraordinary trauma manifested as acute anxiety, and other extenuating circumstances beyond my control. 
The rape marked my first (non-consentual) sexual experience with a man, something I had long put off due to a preference for 
abstinence and safety of my personal health. 

The man gradually began to stalk and harass me again 
after I moved back into a residence of refuge with family members in the state of Florida around April of 2015. 
Years later, in the fall of 2017, I moved to the state of Georgia to complete my Ph.D. course at another 
local university closer to my support system at home. 
My rapist and long-time stalker once again, without fail, reappeared there some time after this move as well. 
I eventually filed a police report in early 2019 with the campus police department to obtain documentation for a temporary 
restraining order should I need to invoke it. While I was there, with a good friend and campus victims advocacy counselor in the 
room to support my claims and lend credibility to my statements, 
I communicated to the detectives that took my complaints and pieces of my story that I was ready to report the 
violent rape I was a victim of in 2014. They informed me that due to state-level jurisdiction, I would have to be in touch with the 
Seattle Police Department to make the report and file my allegations with law enforcement authorities over the phone there. 
The victims advocacy counselor 
helped me to make preliminary contacts with the Washington State authorities. It was communicated to me, through her, that there was 
a precendent in Seattle, WA that victims of rape and/or sexual assault had one year to confront their attacker to state authorities, or else I 
would not be given any recourse by criminal prosecution of the man who had done this to me. 

This realization took a grave 
toll on me, worsened the acute anxiety and PTSD symptoms I had been manifesting post-rape for years, and led me into a hopeless panicked state 
of overwhelming depression. In the late summer months of 2019, while extremely intoxicated on alcohol and anti-anxiety sedative medications, 
I attempted to take my own life rather than continue to cope with what this man had done to me. 
Later in 2019, while trying to reconcile my experiences with my purpose in this life, I finally decided that a police report documentation should be filed by me so that if this 
man were to ever victimize another woman again, there would be a paper trail to help her heal and move forward. 
In the process of writing out preliminary drafts of my initial statement to Seattle Police officials, I encountered the following 
new policy that was adpoted by the WA state legislature in 2019 (see [Declaration—2019 c 87](https://app.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=9A.04.080)): 

>Social service agencies providing support to victims of sexual assault have long known that sexual assault crimes are among the most underreported of all types of crime. According to the department of justice, only two hundred thirty out of every one thousand sexual assaults are reported to police. In the wake of the recent #MeToo movement, this fact has become clear to the broader public.
>
>The statute of limitations restricts a prosecutor's ability to hold perpetrators accountable when reports of crime are delayed. There are many different reasons why victims of sexual assault delay or even choose to never report the crime that has been committed against them. Advances in the field of neurobiology have demonstrated how sexual assault trauma and trauma responses may contribute to delayed victim reporting. Sometimes the victim is in a relationship with the perpetrator - an employer, parent, teacher, or some other person with supervisory power over the victim – causing the victim to believe that further harm will come to them if they report the crime. Further, technological and scientific advances in investigation, collection, documentation, and preservation of evidence have advanced law enforcement and prosecutorial abilities to investigate and prosecute these older cases. Realizing this, policymakers across the country have reevaluated and amended statutes of limitation to extend the allowable time to prosecute sexual assault crimes.
>
>It is generally true that the longer a victim waits to report a crime, the more difficult it will be for the case to be successfully prosecuted. However, the statute of limitations should not prohibit prosecution for these heinous offenses when there is adequate evidence. Extending or eliminating the statute of limitations in these cases is imperative to provide access to justice for victims, hold perpetrators accountable, and enhance community protection.

I was uncharacteristically overjoyed at this realization on new years eve of 2019. 
I knew at that point that the early adopting state of Washington would be just perhaps the first of a 
nationwide trend towards enforcing a state-level policy of more expansive rights for victims of rape and sexual assault. My reason for getting out of 
bed every day in 2020 is now, at least in part, tied towards making something positive out of the overwhelming violence that happened to me and has 
hung a shameful dark auora over my sense of self for many years now. 
I am asking you to help put related provisions onto the books in your state under the inspirational and powerful advocacy 
invoked by the namesake of the #MeToo movement. 

Please join me with your pledged support for victims rights and helping survivors of sexual assault heal and move on following this 
traumatic life experience. 
I would be happy to communicate with your office further about my individual story if it in any way will help the 
wheels of this important policymaking movement get rolling more broadly towards a nationwide standard of victims rights. 

Sincerely,
